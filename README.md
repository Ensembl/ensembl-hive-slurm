Slurm Meadow for eHive
======================

[eHive](https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-hive) is a system for running computation pipelines on distributed computing resources - clusters, farms or grids.

This repository is the implementation of eHive's _Meadow_ interface for the SLURM job scheduler.

:warning: This repository is a fork of [tweep/ensembl-hive-slurm](https://github.com/tweep/ensembl-hive-slurm), and host changes required for a test.
Commits will eventually be fed back to the original repository.
